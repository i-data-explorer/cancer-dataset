# Cancer

An Uncontrollable growth of cells, a disease of mitosis which creates a clump of cancerous cells (tumor), interfering with the healthy functioning of vital organs essential to sustain our life. 

Cancer is determined with a Biopsy, we have biospecimen records with metrics usefull to identify the type of cancer. A prediction attempt is made, by utilizing biospecimen report observations, and combining it with some generic clinical information to determine the Cancer type
to predict the cancer mentioned in the primary diagnosis using an XGBoost Classifier model with and accuracy of 86%.

### Bonus Fact
The increased number of Cell Division (mitosis) increases the risk of Cancer. This leads to the assumption that, larger animals are more prone to cancer due to more mitosis. However, very large animals like Elephants and Blue whales do not have cancer because of a Zombie gene which kills cancerous cells.
